# Analysis_of_pollution_on_polymeric_insulators

In this project, 33 & 11 kV polymeric insulators were subjected to natural atmospheric pollution in a coastal region. The exposed insulators were periodically subjected to high voltages in a High Voltage Engineering lab to monitor their leakage currents and breakdown voltages. The monitoring is done over winter and summer seasons to study the variation of insulators' parameters with weather changes.

The study has shown that the leakage current and breakdown voltage are proportional and inversely proportional, respectively, to the thickness of the contaminants layer on the insulators; It also showcased that the polymeric insulators have better performance in summer compared to winter. The study established a mathematical model relating to the breakdown voltage and the number of testing days.

This project helps in understanding the service life of polymeric insulators and useful as a benchmark for the new transmission lines.
